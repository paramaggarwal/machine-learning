## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project

**Note**

The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal component, where you can receive valuable feedback about your project idea, design, and proposed solution. This must be completed prior to your implementation and submitting for the capstone project. 

You can find the [capstone proposal rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/410/view), and the [capstone project rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view). Please ensure that you are following directions correctly before submitting these two stages which encapsulate your capstone.

Please email [machine-support@udacity.com](mailto:machine-support@udacity.com) if you have any questions.

# Summary

1. Download 2000 images from the Myntra catalog.
2. Using only the ones that are either topwear/bottomwear, we train a network.
3. The network is a Convolutional Neural Network built using Keras.
4. We test the model on five random images from the catalog.

# Run

1. `brew cask install miniconda`
2. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. `source activate myntra`
4. `jupyter notebook Start.ipynb`
